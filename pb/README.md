# Starting the Database Container

## RUNNING THE SCRIPT

With Docker installed, use the following command in this folder: ' docker compose up -d --build '

This will create a docker container with a Pocketbase admin dashboard running on localhost:8090/\_/.

The default admin credentials for this container are: testing@parx.site with the password testingparx. These credentials will be changed in production.
